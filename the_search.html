        <h3>When everything seems too good to be true, nothing is a coincidence.…</h3>
        <p>Sydney’s world will never be the same, but the demands of the Medina Grand Hotel remain unchanged. Guests to check in, rooms to reset, problem visitors to restrain, and portals to protect. Life is unusually usual for Sydney.</p>
        <p>Until Raymond and Kingston return from their European summer with renewed vigour. Raymond has decoded sections of Redmond Barry’s journal, revealing new key locations, and his sights are set on the gold-mining town of Ballarat. No time is wasted, and the trio are soon on their way.</p>
        <p>As their quest invites them into the history of Ballarat, strange circumstances unfold. A man with a cane and a dubiously common name who appears at exactly the right moment. A sentry keeping watch outside their hotel room come hail or shine. A troublesome guest attempting to access the portals in Adelaide. Everything seems oddly connected, but nothing adds up.</p>
        <p>Troubled by the past, the trio perseveres. But with every new discovery, questions remain unanswered. Where Ballarat leads them, they could never predict.</p>
