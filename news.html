        <h3>I'm Republished</h3>
        <h4>June 17, 2025</h4>
        <p><b>Portal is once more out there</b></p>
        <p>
          So it has been a long few months. After the collapse of my publisher, I was left thinking I had to start from scratch. However, an amazing thing happened. A community sprung up from everyone impacted by Shawline. That community has helped each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The person who formatted my book still had the files, and I was able to get in contact with them. I worked with them to put together a second edition of Portal. They did it for nothing, and I can’t put my gratitude into words. Also, my amazing graphic designer sister did a new cover for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, after a few months of work, Portal is once more available to purchase. It’s slowly feeding out to various storefronts. I released both a paperback and ebook version. No hardcover this time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan on staying part of the community that developed. I’m also doing another editing pass on The Search, the second book in the Portal series. Right now, I’m looking for filtering and editing it out where possible. It seems to be a crutch of mine that needs to go. If everything goes to plan, The Search should be out by the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          So things have risen from the ashes of Shawline. So many of the authors have republished, and I’m sure many more will. It’s not the end when your publisher goes under. Mind you - I didn’t see a single cent of royalities owed and likely never will. That’s the only downside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep up your own writing.

        <h3>What a Few Months</h3>
        <h4>November 26, 2024</h4>
        <p><b>Life really is a rollercoaster</b></p>
        <p>
          Oh boy. It’s been a busy few months since I last posted. Portal was released, and then unreleased. I got a publishing offer for my fantasy novel, and then I read the contract. All sorts of things have happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, what happened with Portal. When I last posted it was two days before the release of my contemporary Science-Fiction novel, Portal. I held the book in my hands, and was overjoyed. Then, a month later, came the devastating news. My publisher was going into liquidation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot has been written about Shawline Publishing, including on Writer’s Beware. It came out that they weren’t paying royalties to their authors. I never got a cent from them. They were a hybrid publisher so I put money in and got nothing back. Luckily I retained all the rights for my book, and a strong community has built up amongst the former authors and workers of the publisher. I’m currently working on the 2nd Edition of the novel, and hope to have it out in a few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then comes my fantasy novel, Illina. Illina is a pet project. I started writing it long ago, with my first draft finished in 2004. In 2021 I completely rewrote it from scratch. I also wrote the two sequals. Earlier this year I sent out it out to query with various publishers. Just over a week ago I got an offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I read the contract. They want the rights forever, and won’t compensate me for dirivitive works. No. No no no. This is a bad contract. I’ve sent it to a few people who know more about this things than me, and they’ve pointed out all the issues in the contract. I’m compiling a list of problems to send to the publisher to see if they’ll rework it. If not, I’m going to have to reject the offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yes, a rollercoaster few months. Who says the life of an author is boring, huh?

        <h3>Two Days To Go</h3>
        <h4>August 24, 2024</h4>
        <p>
          In two days I will be a published author. It’s hard to believe after the long road that it has taken. Portal was written in 2019, but the original idea comes from the mid-2000s. It was an idea stemmed from a group of Torchwood fans on a chat group asking ‘what would the Torchwood Team watch on television”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally Portal was supposed to have a co-writer, but sadly life got in the way for the other person. We have grown apart since then. I ended up flying solo to write Portal. It was supposed to be a trilogy of books, but I squashed it down into one book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Portal is now a series with four additional books written and sitting on my computer, waiting for me to get around to publishing them. I’m focusing on the first book. A huge thank you to Shawline Publishing for taking a chance on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the nerves are setting in. I hope you all like it.

        <h3>The Orange Pen</h3>
        <h4>April 25, 2024</h4>
        <p>
          When I got my first notebook, I knew I needed a pen. My school had a “pen licence”, where if you proved your writing in cursive to be good, you would upgrade to being allowed to use a pen in class. I earned mine in Grade Three. Looking back now, I should never have gotten it, as my cursive handwriting was poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, I got a pen licence and needed a pen. That’s where my orange pen came in. I wasn’t allowed to use it at school, so I used it in my personal writing notebook. My first novel, “The Underwater Cavern”, was written with this orange pen. When I used it, people knew I was writing fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It eventually ran out, and I never got another orange pen. It’s hard to read, so that was probably a good thing. Sadly, my handwriting has never recovered from learning cursive, and it’s still difficult to read. This is fitting, as I was a teacher, and they say teachers and doctors have the worst handwriting.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes miss that orange pen. I assume it ended up in the bin, but I can still remember it. It will always hold a special place with me. 
        </p>

        <h3>My First Book</h3>
        <h4>March 28, 2024</h4>
        <p>
          I wrote my first novel when I was eight. I remember walking through the discount store and spotting a colourful notebook on the shelves. I asked my mother for it, and she bought it and an orange pen. I spent much of my free time writing in that book.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote a story about an underwater cavern. My friends and I discovered it while diving and had adventures there. It was a cute story, albeit not very good, and I killed everyone in the end. I don’t know why.
        </p>
        <p>
          My library teacher loved it and my mother spent a few nights on a typewriter typing it up so it was readable. Then, my library teacher sent it into Penguin. I got my first rejection letter when I was nine.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the start of my time as a writer.
