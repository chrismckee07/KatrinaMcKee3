          <p><b>The Search coming soon</b></p>
          <p>
            It’s been a while, but I am happy to announce that Book 2 of the <em>Portal Series</em> is almost here. I have been working with Coven Press for my editing and formatting, and my lovely sister Kristine for my cover. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The Search</em> brings Sydney, Kingston and Raymond to Ballarat in search of a list of keys that Raymond compiled while on vacation in Europe with Kingston. Redmond Barry has ties to the goldfields city, and hid several keys there while visiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, not everything goes as planned. Back in Adelaide, Rita and Jake have issues with a problem guest, and in Ballarat the trio discover they are being watched. And who is the man that keeps turning up?
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The Search</em> is a labour of love to my home town of Ballarat. I spent the first 21 years of my life there, and it was amazing writing about the landmarks of the city and researching their history. It was fun to take the characters there and have them interact with those landmarks. 
          </p>
          <p>
            While <em>The Search</em> is only Book 2 of the series, I have written seven books so far. So there is plenty more to come in the <em>Portal Series</em>. I can’t wait for you all to get your hands on it. The planned release date is <strong>March 1st 2026.</strong>

        <h3 class="news-header">The Stories in Objects</h3>
        <div class = "news-content">
          <h4>Oct 30, 2025</h4>
          <p><b>Every object has a story</b></p>
          <p>
            I lost a ring yesterday.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not an expensive ring. It’s not even that fancy. Just a Celtic band made of silver. It used to fit on my ring finger, but now I wear it on my little finger on the right hand because I grew.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve worn the ring for 25 years. I bought it at a theme park (Sovereign Hill in Ballarat) when I was 15, and every time I look at it I remember all the times I went to that theme park. My family had an annual pass. This theme park is an 1850s experience, with horse drawn carriages, mines to tour, and vintage storefronts. You can pan for gold in the creek, go bowling with wooden balls, and watch as candles and wooden items are made using old methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ring also reminded me of when I first moved out at 21. I moved out for a job in a rural school, three hours from my home. I lived in a tiny flat where methane filled the house when you ran the tap in the kitchen. The ceiling was caving in in the living room, and the front steps were rotten. The hot water service split and the air conditioner died - I lived in the Wimmera in Victoria, so air con was essential. When I was moving out I almost lost the ring behind the stove after shaking my hands to dry them. We had to move the stove to retrieve it.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are all memories the one ring brings back up when I look at it. It’s not expensive, but it has stories to tell. Priceless, sentimental stories. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Every object tells a story. You can look at anything in your house, and you’ll often remember where you got it, and stories about it. I look at my tv and think about how it died a year ago and we had to get it fixed, and our oldest cat was confused by its absence. I can see a video game box, and I remember lining up at midnight for it’s release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a look at any object around you. Can you remember it’s story? Even if you don’t, it still has one. How it came into your possession. Why it sits where it sits now. That’s why when things are stolen it hurts so much. It’s not just the monetary value of an object, it’s the memories the object brings. Even my computer I’m writing on now has a story to tell. Does yours?
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is I found my ring. It was hiding in one of my pockets. Now I have a new story tied to it. The story of when I almost lost it, and how it triggered the idea to write this post.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re stuck for a writing prompt, perhaps look around you. Pick an object. Tells it’s story. You’ll be surprised how much it has to say.

        <h3 class="news-header">The Curse of the Mary Sue</h3>
        <div class = "news-content">
          <h4>Oct 08, 2025</h4>
          <p><b>Being careful when creating characters</b></p>
          <p>
            Mary Sue is one of the most hated characters in writing. She (and her male counterpart, Gary Stu) pop up in original fiction and fan fiction alike. Mary Sue is a character that is so perfect and flawless everything rolls off her back, no matter what happens. She is gifted and hot, and all the boys (and girls) want to either be with her, or be her.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fan fiction, she is usually an original character created by the author. Often the long lost sister (usually twin) of a main character, and desired by a significant other character who she ends up with. She’s a self-insertion of the author. A placeholder for what the author wishes would happen to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            She/he appears in original fiction too. Have you ever read a novel where you think “I just can’t gel with this character, they have no flaws and the whole world seems to be with them”. You most likely have a Mary Sue/Gary Stu on your hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve seen it work. In the 2016 anime <i>Haven’t You Heard? My Name is Sakamoto</i> (based on a manga by the same name) the title character is Sakamoto, a perfect male character who can do no wrong, is hot and wanted by all the girls, and all the boys want to be him. Even when other characters set him up to fail, he easily brushes it off and makes it look cool. But that doesn’t make it a bad anime/manga. You see, while he is the title character, the actual anime is about his classmates and how <i>they</i> grow through knowing him. His perfection is what helps them build themselves. It’s used as a comedic device and also creates deep, meaningful stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve also seen it used poorly. When co-writing a fan fiction with someone almost a decade ago, they turned a main character into a Gary Stu. The usually flawed and careful character became a whiny, perfect teenager demanded everything. A self-insertion of the other writer. It ruined the character, ruined the experience of co-writing, and the story is now delisted from <i>Archive of Our Own</i> (Ao3) because I don’t want my name attached to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve been guilty of it. When I did my first draft of my fantasy novel <i>Illina</i>, the title character was very heavily a Mary Sue. She was 15, gifted, looked like me, had all the boys falling at her feet. She learned every new skill quickly and easily, and had no flaws. I wrote this when I was 18, but I rewrote it in my 30s. While she still looks a little like me, she is no longer gifted. She isn’t looking for love, the boys no longer throw themselves at her. She shares the spotlight with her older brother. She’s average in learning new skills, but focuses because she knows it’s life or death. Her brother bests her in swordplay despite him being a pacifist (a problem when you’re at war) and she’s better at magic. And she doesn’t get a romantic interest until the third book in the trilogy when she’s a little older.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m more careful with my writing these days. With <i>Portal</i>, I tried to create balanced characters. Sydney is a people person and people pleaser, but way too trusting to the point it hurts her. Raymond is good at what he does, but only after years of isolation to learn the skill, and now he’s overconfident and cocky. Kingston is good looking and a charmer, but secludes himself and has few friends. Rita can get the job done and negotiate like the best of them, but people find her aloof and bossy. Jake is paranoid, but that’s what makes him good at being Head of Security. 
          </p>
          <p>
            All of their strengths and faults compliment each other, and add to the story and series as a whole. They have to work on their flaws, and they rub off on each other (not always in a good way). It’s part of how I created them. I look for areas the character is good at, then find a balanced flaw. Raymond rushes into things because he thinks he can handle it because of his training, and it often backfires. Sydney wants to make everyone happy as is her job as a Hotel Manager, but because she trusts everyone, people take advantage of her. It adds to the conflict of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I have advice, it’s to create balanced characters. Don’t self-insert unless you’re writing a memoir (obviously). But don’t give characters flaws for flaws sake. They need to make sense to the character.
          </p>
          <p>
            Happy writing, and remember, <a href="https://katrinamckee.com.au/portal.html"><i>Portal</i> is available to buy now.</a>

        <h3 class="news-header">The Big 'Why'</h3>
        <div class = "news-content">
          <h4>Sep 18, 2025</h4>
          <p><b>Why do you write?</b></p>
          <p>
            They say one of the first questions you should ask yourself when you’re writing is ‘why’? Why do you write? What do you want to get out of it? Is it for fame and glory? Is it to leave a legacy? Is it to get all the ideas out of your head and onto paper/the screen?
          </p>
          <p>
            My big why is simple - because I enjoy it. I love writing. It has always been a part of me, even in my youth. My first book was written when I was 8. It was titled ‘The Underwater Cavern’, and was about a group of friends who discover a magical cavern under the ocean. I used the real names of my friends at the time, and one of my teachers liked it so much she submitted it to Penguin. It was rejected. My first rejection letter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have written several books since. My first full length novel was written when I was 18. It was a fantasy novel about the battle between two princes and a random farm girl caught in the middle. I’ve since rewritten it because the main character was a complete Mary Sue (ie. perfect and self-insertion). It’s now a trilogy. I’ve submitted it to a few places, and have feedback that it needs developmental editing so I will do that before I submit anywhere else.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Portal Series currently has five books written for it. I’m about to sign the contract to commence editing on book 2, The Search. The feedback I’ve had so far on book one has been positive, with people looking for the next book. That’s a good sign. I’m writing book 6, so my backlog has me set for a few years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from the Portal Series, and my fantasy trilogy, I have a steamy gay romance trilogy. It was originally a 300,000+ word fan fiction that I have reworked and tweaked. I’ve only submitted to one place so far, and will most likely publish under a psuedonym. That will also need editing. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The question is: why do you write? Or even - why do you read? What is your big ‘why’? I’d be curious to hear. Let me know.

          <p><b>Portal is once more out there</b></p>
          <p>
            So it has been a long few months. After the collapse of my publisher, I was left thinking I had to start from scratch. However, an amazing thing happened. A community sprung up from everyone impacted by Shawline. That community has helped each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            The person who formatted my book still had the files, and I was able to get in contact with them. I worked with them to put together a second edition of Portal. They did it for nothing, and I can’t put my gratitude into words. Also, my amazing graphic designer sister did a new cover for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, after a few months of work, Portal is once more available to purchase. It’s slowly feeding out to various storefronts. I released both a paperback and ebook version. No hardcover this time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan on staying part of the community that developed. I’m also doing another editing pass on The Search, the second book in the Portal series. Right now, I’m looking for filtering and editing it out where possible. It seems to be a crutch of mine that needs to go. If everything goes to plan, The Search should be out by the end of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            So things have risen from the ashes of Shawline. So many of the authors have republished, and I’m sure many more will. It’s not the end when your publisher goes under. Mind you - I didn’t see a single cent of royalities owed and likely never will. That’s the only downside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep up your own writing.

        <h3 class="news-header">What a Few Months</h3>
        <div class = "news-content">
          <h4>November 26, 2024</h4>
          <p><b>Life really is a rollercoaster</b></p>
          <p>
            Oh boy. It’s been a busy few months since I last posted. Portal was released, and then unreleased. I got a publishing offer for my fantasy novel, and then I read the contract. All sorts of things have happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, what happened with Portal. When I last posted it was two days before the release of my contemporary Science-Fiction novel, Portal. I held the book in my hands, and was overjoyed. Then, a month later, came the devastating news. My publisher was going into liquidation.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot has been written about Shawline Publishing, including on Writer’s Beware. It came out that they weren’t paying royalties to their authors. I never got a cent from them. They were a hybrid publisher so I put money in and got nothing back. Luckily I retained all the rights for my book, and a strong community has built up amongst the former authors and workers of the publisher. I’m currently working on the 2nd Edition of the novel, and hope to have it out in a few months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then comes my fantasy novel, Illina. Illina is a pet project. I started writing it long ago, with my first draft finished in 2004. In 2021 I completely rewrote it from scratch. I also wrote the two sequals. Earlier this year I sent out it out to query with various publishers. Just over a week ago I got an offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I read the contract. They want the rights forever, and won’t compensate me for dirivitive works. No. No no no. This is a bad contract. I’ve sent it to a few people who know more about this things than me, and they’ve pointed out all the issues in the contract. I’m compiling a list of problems to send to the publisher to see if they’ll rework it. If not, I’m going to have to reject the offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            So yes, a rollercoaster few months. Who says the life of an author is boring, huh?

          <h4>August 24, 2024</h4>
          <p>
            In two days I will be a published author. It’s hard to believe after the long road that it has taken. Portal was written in 2019, but the original idea comes from the mid-2000s. It was an idea stemmed from a group of Torchwood fans on a chat group asking ‘what would the Torchwood Team watch on television”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally Portal was supposed to have a co-writer, but sadly life got in the way for the other person. We have grown apart since then. I ended up flying solo to write Portal. It was supposed to be a trilogy of books, but I squashed it down into one book.
          </p>
          <p>
            Portal is now a series with four additional books written and sitting on my computer, waiting for me to get around to publishing them. I’m focusing on the first book. A huge thank you to Shawline Publishing for taking a chance on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the nerves are setting in. I hope you all like it.

        <h3 class="news-header">The Orange Pen</h3>
        <div class = "news-content">
          <h4>April 25, 2024</h4>
          <p>
            When I got my first notebook, I knew I needed a pen. My school had a “pen licence”, where if you proved your writing in cursive to be good, you would upgrade to being allowed to use a pen in class. I earned mine in Grade Three. Looking back now, I should never have gotten it, as my cursive handwriting was poor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, I got a pen licence and needed a pen. That’s where my orange pen came in. I wasn’t allowed to use it at school, so I used it in my personal writing notebook. My first novel, “The Underwater Cavern”, was written with this orange pen. When I used it, people knew I was writing fiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            It eventually ran out, and I never got another orange pen. It’s hard to read, so that was probably a good thing. Sadly, my handwriting has never recovered from learning cursive, and it’s still difficult to read. This is fitting, as I was a teacher, and they say teachers and doctors have the worst handwriting.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I sometimes miss that orange pen. I assume it ended up in the bin, but I can still remember it. It will always hold a special place with me.

          <p>
            I wrote my first novel when I was eight. I remember walking through the discount store and spotting a colourful notebook on the shelves. I asked my mother for it, and she bought it and an orange pen. I spent much of my free time writing in that book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote a story about an underwater cavern. My friends and I discovered it while diving and had adventures there. It was a cute story, albeit not very good, and I killed everyone in the end. I don’t know why.
          </p>
          <p>
            My library teacher loved it and my mother spent a few nights on a typewriter typing it up so it was readable. Then, my library teacher sent it into Penguin. I got my first rejection letter when I was nine.
          </p>

            That was the start of my time as a writer.
