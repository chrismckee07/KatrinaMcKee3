        <h3>My First Book</h3>
        <h4>Mar 28, 2024</h4>
        <p>
          I wrote my first novel when I was eight. I remember walking through the discount store and spotting a colourful notebook on the shelves. I asked my mother for it, and she bought it and an orange pen. I spent much of my free time writing in that book.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote a story about an underwater cavern. My friends and I discovered it while diving and had adventures there. It was a cute story, albeit not very good, and I killed everyone in the end. I don’t know why.
        </p>
        <p>
          My library teacher loved it and my mother spent a few nights on a typewriter typing it up so it was readable. Then, my library teacher sent it into Penguin. I got my first rejection letter when I was nine.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the start of my time as a writer.

        <h3>The Orange Pen</h3>
        <h4>Apr 25, 2024</h4>
        <p>
          When I got my first notebook, I knew I needed a pen. My school had a “pen licence”, where if you proved your writing in cursive to be good, you would upgrade to being allowed to use a pen in class. I earned mine in Grade Three. Looking back now, I should never have gotten it, as my cursive handwriting was poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, I got a pen licence and needed a pen. That’s where my orange pen came in. I wasn’t allowed to use it at school, so I used it in my personal writing notebook. My first novel, “The Underwater Cavern”, was written with this orange pen. When I used it, people knew I was writing fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It eventually ran out, and I never got another orange pen. It’s hard to read, so that was probably a good thing. Sadly, my handwriting has never recovered from learning cursive, and it’s still difficult to read. This is fitting, as I was a teacher, and they say teachers and doctors have the worst handwriting.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I sometimes miss that orange pen. I assume it ended up in the bin, but I can still remember it. It will always hold a special place with me.

        <h3>Two Days To Go</h3>
        <h4>Aug 24, 2024</h4>
        <p>
          In two days I will be a published author. It’s hard to believe after the long road that it has taken. Portal was written in 2019, but the original idea comes from the mid-2000s. It was an idea stemmed from a group of Torchwood fans on a chat group asking ‘what would the Torchwood Team watch on television”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally Portal was supposed to have a co-writer, but sadly life got in the way for the other person. We have grown apart since then. I ended up flying solo to write Portal. It was supposed to be a trilogy of books, but I squashed it down into one book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Portal is now a series with four additional books written and sitting on my computer, waiting for me to get around to publishing them. I’m focusing on the first book. A huge thank you to Shawline Publishing for taking a chance on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the nerves are setting in. I hope you all like it.
